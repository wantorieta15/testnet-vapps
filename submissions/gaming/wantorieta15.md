Experience: Smart contract and dApp developer with experience in NFTs, gaming, and zk-tech.




2. Project Overview

Name: NFTQuest
Category: Gaming / NFTs / Entertainment
Summary:
NFTQuest is a play-to-earn vApp that uses the Soundness Layer to guarantee fair gameplay, low-cost NFT minting, and anti-bot protection. Players complete quests, defeat challenges, and earn provably fair NFTs as rewards.



3. Problem Statement

Current NFT-based games face:

❌ Unfair reward systems – Drop rates and rewards can be manipulated.

❌ High transaction costs – NFT minting is often expensive and slow.

❌ Botting & abuse – Multi-account exploits reduce fairness for real players.




4. Proposed Solution

NFTQuest solves these issues by integrating the Soundness Layer:

🔐 zk-Proof verified fairness – All quest rewards validated on-chain.

⚡ Batch minting optimization – Lower costs for NFT generation.

👥 Reputation-based identity – Prevents botting and ensures genuine participation.




5. Key Features

1. 🎁 Quest-based NFT rewards with verifiable randomness.


2. ⚔️ Multiplayer/social gameplay with trade & PvP options.


3. 📊 Reputation system to block bots and multi-account abuse.


4. 🌐 On-chain metadata stored via IPFS for transparency.





6. Technical Design

Architecture:

Frontend → Quest Orchestration Backend → Smart Contracts → Soundness Layer Proofs.

NFTs minted only after zkProof validation.


Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + WalletConnect

Backend: Node.js

Smart Contracts: Solidity (ERC-721)

Integration: Soundness Layer zk-Proofs

Storage: IPFS for metadata




7. Development Timeline

Phase 1 – PoC (2–4 weeks)

Build quest logic & NFT smart contract

Basic zkProof integration with SL

Simple React UI for quest participation


Phase 2 – MVP (4–8 weeks)

Full quest system with 3+ levels

Reputation-based anti-bot integration

Optimized batch minting

Testnet deployment + community testing



8. Expected Outcomes

🎮 A working PoC game on testnet with 3 provably fair quests.

🪙 Transparent NFT reward system powered by zkProofs.

👥 Proof that Soundness Layer can elevate NFT gaming trust.
